## About

Performance Model Calculator is a tool designed to support high performance software system development.
It provides performance data for requirements and design choices and facilitates comparison of software and hardware alternatives for solving performance problems.

## Execution Graph

Software Model is represented as an Execution Graph. Each block in the Execution Graph represents an action that is
quantitatively described by its annotation.
Software Model be used as a target 
 - to evaluate upper and lower bound in the system performance,
 - to identify software performance bottleneck in the business logic  

## Queuing networks model

Queueing network modelling is a particular approach to computer system modelling in which the computer system 
is represented as a network of queues which is evaluated analytically.
A network of queues is a collection of service centers, which represent system resources, 
and customers, which represent users or transactions.
Analytic evaluation involves using software to solve efficiently a
set of equations induced by the network of queues and its parameters.
